This folder should contain all the preprocessed data.

Unfortunately the rules of the contest clearly state that:

"Sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. This includes making code or data made available to all participants, such as on the forums."

For this reason we are not allowed to reshare the data in this repo.

In order to have all the preprocessed dataset here you should create them by running the scripts in the folder "01. Data Prearation & Preprocessing".
Before doing that, make sure you have downloaded the original dataset into the folder "Data". You will find instruction to do it inside that folder.
