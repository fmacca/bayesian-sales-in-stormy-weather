Unfortunately the rules of the contest clearly state that:

"Sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. This includes making code or data made available to all participants, such as on the forums."

For this reason we are not allowed to reshare the data in this repo.

However you can pretty easily download it yourself from the source by joining the kaggle competition at this link:

Just save all the files in this folder and you are good to go!

Important datasets are:

- test.csv
- train.csv
